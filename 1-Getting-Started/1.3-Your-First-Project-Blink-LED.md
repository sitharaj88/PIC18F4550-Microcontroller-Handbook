# 1.3 Your First Project: Blink an LED üí°

Blinking an LED is the perfect first project to get started with the PIC18F4550 microcontroller. This simple project will help you understand GPIO configuration, code compilation, and uploading programs to the microcontroller.

## üåü **Hardware Requirements**
- **PIC18F4550 microcontroller**
- **PICkit Programmer** (e.g., PICkit 3/4)
- **LED** (any color)
- **220Œ© Resistor** (to limit current)
- **Breadboard and jumper wires**
- **USB cable** (for power/programming)

## üöÄ **Step-by-Step Guide**

### **Step 1: Build the Circuit**
1. Connect the **PIC18F4550** to your breadboard.
2. Connect the **LED anode** (long leg) to **PORTB0 (RB0)** via a **220Œ© resistor**.
3. Connect the **LED cathode** (short leg) to **GND**.
4. Power the circuit using a **5V supply** (e.g., USB or external power).

### **Step 2: Write the Code**
Create a new MPLAB X project and write the following code in `main.c`:

```c
#include <xc.h>
#pragma config FOSC = INTOSC_HS  // Use internal oscillator at 48 MHz
#define _XTAL_FREQ 48000000      // Define clock frequency for delay functions

void main() {
    TRISB0 = 0;  // Set RB0 as output
    
    while(1) {
        LATB0 = 1;   // Turn LED ON
        __delay_ms(500);  // 500ms delay
        LATB0 = 0;   // Turn LED OFF
        __delay_ms(500);  // 500ms delay
    }
} 
```

### **Step 3: Configure the Project**
1. In MPLAB X, ensure the PIC18F4550 is selected as the device.
2. Set the XC8 compiler as the toolchain
3. Configure the PICkit programmer in the project properties.

### **Step 4: Build and Upload**
1. Click the Clean and Build button (hammer icon) to compile the code.
2. Click the Make and Program Device button (lightning bolt icon) to upload the code.

### **Step 5: Observe the Result**
The LED should blink at a 1-second interval (500ms ON, 500ms OFF)!

## üìù **Code Explanation**
+ TRISB0 = 0: Configures RB0 as an output pin.

+ LATB0 = 1/LATB0 = 0: Sets RB0 high/low to turn the LED ON/OFF.

+ __delay_ms(500): Creates a 500ms delay (requires _XTAL_FREQ definition).  

## üêõ **Troubleshooting**
+ LED Not Blinking:
  + Check connections (RB0 ‚Üî LED ‚Üî Resistor ‚Üî GND).

  + Verify the LED polarity (long leg = anode).

+ Code Not Uploading:

  + Ensure the PICkit programmer is properly connected.

  + Check the power supply to the PIC18F4550.

+ Incorrect Timing:

  + Confirm _XTAL_FREQ matches your clock settings.
